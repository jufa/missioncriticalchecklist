# missioncriticalchecklist

Private pilots are using iPads more and more to manage digital documentation. 

One area where digital documentation falls behind is Checklists, a vital and proven safety process and tool for aviation, space, and even surgery

This project aims to create a checklist App that allows pilots to 

 - create checklists using a simple email and markdown notation
 - manage their checlists on the iPad
 - use and re-use checklists, with automated 'missed item' and interactive tracking and timiing features
 - audit checklist performance from past uses
